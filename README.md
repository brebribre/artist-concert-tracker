Cracker

This project displays both a search method for looking up artists' names to find the corresponding concert tour date, and also a feature to get a biography of all K-Pop idols with a database that I collected via web scrapping.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
